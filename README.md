# Go-File-Encryption-Tool

Because Golang and security are cool.

This was a tutorial led, simple project resulting in an easy to use cli tool.

1. With Golang installed, run "go build" from the project directory.
2. Run the executable with input and output file names as args
3. May have to chmod +x if unable to run the program.
